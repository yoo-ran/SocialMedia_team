                    <p>Arabica coffee beans are the most popular and widely consumed type of coffee beans.

They often have a pleasant acidity and a bit of sweetness, with a wide range of flavor notes, including fruity, floral, and nutty undertones. The taste can be quite complex.

They have a higher caffeine content than Arabica beans and offer a more bitter and earthy taste. Robusta beans are often used in espresso blends for their ability to create a rich crema and a strong, full-bodied coffee. These beans are hardier and can thrive at lower altitudes in hotter climates.
